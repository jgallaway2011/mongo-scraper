# mongoscraper
App to scrap articles and then store them in Mongo DB along with comments the users might add about them

To-dos:

1) Add validation to prevent duplicat articles
2) Fix bug where comments only populate the first article card (potential ID issue)
3) Fix bug where one comment being deleted removed the entire array of comments as opposed to just the one comment from the array.

Nice To-Haves:
1) Put card buttons at equal placing
2) Add more styling for sharpness
