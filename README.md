# mongoscraper
App to scrap articles and then store them in Mongo DB along with comments the users might add about them

To-dos:

1) Figure out modal issue
2) Add routing for comments (Add, delete)
3) Add validation to prevent duplicat articles

Nice To-Haves:
1) Put card buttons at equal placing
2) Use only Bootstrap for home page (possibly resolve modal issue?)
